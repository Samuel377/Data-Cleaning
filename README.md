# Data-Cleaning
Cleaning dirty data using MySQL

Introduction
Data cleaning is an essential step in data preprocessing to ensure the quality and reliability of your dataset. This README provides a guide on how to perform data cleaning using SQL. It covers common data cleaning tasks and offers best practices to help you maintain clean and accurate data.

Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

. A working SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.)
. Basic knowledge of SQL queries
. Access to the dataset that needs cleaning

Getting Started
Connect to your SQL Database: Use your preferred SQL client to connect to your database.
Backup your Data: Always create a backup of your data before performing any cleaning operations.

Common Data Cleaning Tasks
1. Removing Duplicates
Duplicates can skew your analysis and results. Use the DISTINCT keyword or identify duplicates using ROW_NUMBER()
2. Handling Missing Values
Missing values can be handled by removing the rows or filling them with appropriate values
3. Standardizing Data
Standardize data to ensure consistency:
  . Correcting Errors
    Identify and correct errors in your data such as excess spacing in text 
  . Data Type Conversion
    Ensure data is in the correct format of data types

Conclusion
Data cleaning is crucial for accurate and reliable data analysis. Using SQL for data cleaning can streamline the process and handle large datasets efficiently. Follow the outlined steps and best practices to maintain high-quality data in your database.
